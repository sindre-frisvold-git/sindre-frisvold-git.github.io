      <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
      <p class="intro">Wax on wax off</p>
      <p>- <em>Mr. Miyagi</em></p>
      <section>
          <p>Neuroplasticity is the process of the brain continually changing through stimulus. The more you fore one specific pathway, the more that pathway grows and interonnects with other parts of the brain, creating stronger more accessible sections.</p>
      </section>

        <h3>Benefits of understanding:</h3>
        <p>When trying to learn a new skill or concept it is important to understand that you are in fact able to. This coupled with knowledge on how your brain absorbs and utilizes new information are skills you foster through understanding of neuroplasticity. Being able to push through when you get frustrated with the comfort that this is when the brain is making new connections in an effort to understand the material is a very powerful tool to have when absorbing new material.</p>
        <h3>Personal takeaway points:</h3>
        <p>I will utilize the principles of neuroplasticity through understanding of material. I will look at different ways to use new skill sets and combine them with previously practiced skills. This way I will strengthen the bonds and create new pathways to this material which will allow me to access it faster in the future.</p>
        <p>This is one way to increase neuroplasticity, understanding it in context to other concepts. Further You should practice the same skill over and over again in incremental difficulty, this strengthens the existing pathways. Understanding how neuroplasticity works also improves how well it works through acceptance of the methods of utilization.</p>

          <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
          <h3>What is it and why is it relevant?</h3>
          <p>What is referred to as a growth mindset in short is the idea that through effort and challenges you can continue to grow your skills and different avenues of “intelligence”. This is in contrast to the dubbed fixed mindset where an individual is of the belief that innate skill and intelligence is static and does not change throughout life.</p>
          <p>When trying to learn how to do a profession at a level where people will pay you for it in 9 weeks is a significant undertaking to undersell it. During that time you are going to be exposed to concepts completely unfamiliar and very likely challenging. In order to be able to push past the inner critical voice telling you you “just aren’t cut out for this” and stay on course it is invaluable to foster a mindset that embraces challenges as growth. In order to move at pace and get through all the material one needs to be happy to stop mid challenge and move on when required. Seeing the part of the challenge completed as valuable learning will be vital to motivation and momentum.</p>
          <p>Changing the perception of what learning, effort and challenge is is the one most important lesson to be had before starting this course. Learning to embrace a growth mindset is one way to that destination.</p>
          <h3>Personal takeaway points:</h3>
          <p>The more I read about fixed and growth mindsets the more I recognize situations from my own life. In my research I learned that it is possible to have a mix of the mindsets for different aspects of your life which made a lot of sense to me. In some avenues I have embraced challenge and grown considerably in only the last few years, whilst in others I have stayed stagnant for a long time due to the belief that my abilities in those avenues were fixed and static. It is quite a freeing thought.</p>
          <p>I have already noticed a change in how I tackle challenges. Before I would still push through with the belief that I could do it, and I would eventually. Now I see it as I can do it and next time it will get a little bit easier. Similar results at the end, less energy consuming. I would also argue the new mindset will continue to foster healthier pathways in the brain.</p>
          <p>Continuing on, I am committed to tackle challenges with the idea that it will strengthen learning rather than proving that I can do it.  Getting better at something through challenges will lead to me being able to do it anyway; It in this situation being ambiguous. The greatest avenue for growth during this course for me personally will be the core content. I will keep repeating that I can improve through trying over and over when I sense doubt; through this I should be able to create a new neural pathway for future challenges of the same nature.</p>
          <p>I had already started learning about the different mindsets prior to this sprint. If you are interested I highly recommend going through the first few lessons on The Odin Project which covers the same material. This should consolidate your understanding more. I have included a link <a href=”https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/gearing-up”>here</a> to the Odin project page around mindset (you might have to sign up, but it is free!).</p>
