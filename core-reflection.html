      <h1>Core Reflection</h1>
      <p class="intro">In order to better know yourself you need to better understand how you go about better knowing yourself.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I have been deep in a hole thinking I am only as good as the potential I was given at birth.</li>
            <li>As is in hindsight obvious, I can improve my social interactions and move away from destructive behaviour</li>
            <li>I struggle to appear not in control in front of others.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>Having a strong sense of your own values help guide you in learning. Having empathy and self awareness help you bond with others better which allows a collaborative and supportive learning environment.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>The easy shift in mindset towards believing anything can be taught and learned through practice. I had an idea before but I did not buy into it as much. Practicing thinking about it has made it easier to believe and understand. Self fulfilling prophecy?</p>
        <br>
        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>Allowing myself to be honest with myself and also putting it in the public domain. Even though most will skim your posts after reading all the ones being posted, it is still there, available for anyone to read.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>In order to succeed in any field you need to be able to do your job. Not learning these skills definitely puts you behind when it comes to thriving in a team environment. More importantly it teaches you to communicate and collaborate with others better, creating better learning environments during the course just as much as in your inevitable job.</p>
        <p>I also believe this creates a batch of better people than when we came in which is a bonus for the world, ourselves and you as a course as well in case we end up working together one day.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>	I appreciate the time spent working on the core content even though Iâ€™m itching to program instead. I would rather code a calculator now in all honesty but I appreciate the skills I am learning and I have identified a few of them as skills I need to develop in order to succeed.</p>
