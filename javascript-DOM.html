      <h1>Javascript DOM (Document Object Model)</h1>
      <p class="intro">For this post we will be discussing a little bit of Javascript, what the JS DOM is and how we can use it to create more interactive web pages and the components that goes into it.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
        <p>To understand the DOM we first need to understand HTML and CSS. In order to manipulate and change elements on a web page you need to have elements to manipulate and parts of the aforementioned to change. This is where HTML and CSS comes in. They work together to form the skeleton and the decorations of a web page. HTML is the advent calendar with all the rings; CSS are the gifts and decorations hung upon.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Control Flow & Loops</h2>
        <p>When using Javascript to modify the various parts of your webpage you will inevitably have to write some lines of code. To ensure your code executes correctly (i.e., the way you want it to) you also need to have an understanding of Control Flow. Control Flow is the order in which lines of code are acted upon. This affects how your code runs. You could see it as directions from your favorite map app. You get instructions one after another leading you to your destination. This is the same as the control flow; if you place the final instruction right in the middle of the directions it will not make sense and you will get lost.</p>
        <p>On the topic of loops they can be likened to a biathlon (google that one if you do not follow winter sports). You go through a set loop around the track and along the way at the same locations you perform tasks a set amount of times. Sometimes you might trigger a conditional (e.g., you miss too many targets) and you have to take a penalty round. At the end of the loop you finish the competition and get in your car and follow the map instructions to your next destination.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Document Object Model</h2>
        <p>The time you’ve been waiting for! Time to discuss the DOM (see header). The DOM is what you use to control which parts of the web page you want to modify with javascript. It acts as an index of everything on the page with an easy to follow road map to get there. In addition to this it contains a few tools and shortcuts to get to the parts you want easier, almost like bookmarks on demand.</p>
        <p>When you modify the DOM you would be likely to add some form of identification to the HTML parts, one example of this is an ID attribute; essentially an unique identifier for the specific part of the page. One you have this you can use Javascript to target and modify the aforementioned part of the page. You could do pretty much whatever you can imagine with it; some basic examples would be changing size, location or color.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Object and Array data types</h2>
        <p>The DOM is, as the name implies, an object. This could be seen as a shelf with named shelves. On each shelf there could be items or another shelf with it’s own shelves. For this we just have to allow ourselves to imagine an infinitely shrinkable universe where there’s always room for another shelf.</p>
        <p>An array however generally does not have named shelves but would be more like a box with items in it. Inside the box you can put more boxes with more items in them but the boxes would have numbers compared to names.</p>
        <p>When accessing data from arrays and objects you access the contents slightly differently. Since an array generally only contains numbered indexes you access the contents by using those numbers. For example, to access the first index in an array you would use brackets: arr[0].</p>
        <p>For objects you would generally use the name of the shelf you are trying to access. This can be done two different ways. One is by naming the shelf following a dot . : obj.shelf.</p>
        <p>However, some shelves might have names in them which include a space and/or a hyphen or maybe you are trying to use a string to access the specific shelf. In this case you can use brackets to access the same info: obj[“shelf one”].</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Functions</h2>
        <p>To use all these discussed components efficiently you can utilize functions. A function is essentially a prewritten collection of code which can be used over and over again. This can be useful when you want to for example change the color or first letter of a list of paragraphs. You do not want to write a line of code to do this for each paragraph, instead you can write a function which makes the desired changes and apply that function to each paragraph with a loop.</p>
