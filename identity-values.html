            <h2>Personal Values and Beliefs</h2>
            <p>I have split this blog post into two main parts, the first one being my own perception of my core values, the second being the core values seen in me by friends and family</p>
            <h3>My personal view</h3>
            <h4>Kindness</h4>
            <p>I believe there is no good reason to ever step on someone or bring anyone down. Everybody deserves to be treated with respect and dignity.</p>
            <h4>Perceptiveness</h4>
            <p>Being aware of what is happening around you and within others.
                Seeing beyond the tunnel in front of you and having situational awareness can apply to every aspect of your life. Seeing the big picture when you disagree with something. Seeing beyond the surface words of a loved one. Focusing on the important details and disregarding the sensation around them.
            </p>
            <h4>Curiosity</h4>
            <p>Stepping outside your comfort zone and experiencing whatever comes your way free of prejudice and cultural restrictions.</p>
            <p>Don’t be afraid to try that new food that looks odd or sounds weird.</p>
            <p>Don’t be afraid or against experiencing a ceremony or custom from a culture or belief foreign to yourself.</p>
            <p>Don’t be averse to exploring your own beliefs and thoughts about something you like or dislike, the more we learn the more critical we can be of our previous triumphs and ignorance.  Ignorance is not a crime, just a lack of proper guidance and opportunity.</p>
            <p>Embrace new topics or experiences even if they seem boring or uninteresting to you. Someone does find them interesting and there is a reason for that.  This ties heavily into my own “Seaweed Theory” but I will leave that one out of this. If there is interest from the reader feel free to approach me and inquire further.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Seen through the eyes of others</h3>
            <p>I've added comments here where they were provided, I've also added my own commentary for some</p>
            <h4>Family-oriented</h4>
            <p>I grew up in a large immediate family and very loving extended family. This has caused me to view this as an essential pillar in my own life and the ones around me. This side of me has flourished further since having my firstborn.</p>
            <p>I think this one was too deeply rooted for me to mention it in my own core values, we don't mention breathing as a key skill or strength</p>
            <h4>Patient</h4>
            <p>This one came from the mother of my child. I will take this one deeply and appreciate how this makes her feel and what I overcame to become the person I am today.</p>
            <h4>Persistence/Perseverance</h4>
            <p>This one was mentioned by most of my sources. This refers to my belief in that everything will work out as long as I keep going. I believe this mindset has been fostered through the less than ideal idea that males need to be tough and not show any weakness.</p>
            <p>I have moved away from this mentality luckily and I wish to impart the skills of asking for help and the ability to be vulnerable in front of people that matter to you in my son and subsequent offspring be I that lucky!. At lest something good came from that age old social construct.</p>
            <h4>Positive, to a fault</h4>
            <p>I sometimes stay too positive in face of adversity to the point that in the eyes of others I disregard the potential threats or pitfalls.</p>
            <h4>Annoying</h4>
            <p>This one came up, and as I am writing this I actually understand and agree with this one. I have always found enjoyment in trolling people dear to me. My brain tells me what would be the most bothersome outcome of a situation for them and then I make a quick joke about it. This is to my own amusement and I realize that in large doses I can be exhausting to hang around.</p>
            <h4>Goal-oriented</h4>
            <p>This one came as a surprise in the beginning; my mind wanders too much through everything for me to set down specific goals and work through until I reach them. Through enquiring further I realized that I have the ability to get whichever I want done as long as I decide to do it. An example would be deciding one day during my partner’s pregnancy that we need somewhere to live when we start our new family. A few months later we settled and I am writing this in our own home.</p>
