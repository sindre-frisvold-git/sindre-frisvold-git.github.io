      <h1>EQualizer and IQualizer</h1>
      <p class="intro">A difference more profound than pronunciation with a kiwi accent.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
        <p>Emotional intelligence, or EQ as it were, can be described as one individual’s ability to discern, process and act upon the emotional state and response in themselves and others. For example someone with a well trained EQ skill set would be able to predict how an action would affect another person or a crowd. On the flip side of this you would be less likely to see a person with great EQ lose control of their emotions as they would be able to respond to the changes in their emotional state rather than immediately react.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Difference to IQ</h2>
        <p>Comparing IQ to EQ in my eyes is like comparing apples and oranges. They’re both fruits of labor, both juicy and scrumptious and if you drew them in black and white they’d look reasonably similar; the essence, however, is quite different. I think the most pronounced difference would be that a high IQ would be more adept at solving defined, rational and logical problems while a high EQ would be more adept at solving less clear cut, more complex fluid problems.</p>
        <p>This in no way defines either and the differences go far deeper than that. Maybe one could say IQ is understanding the world and EQ is understanding oneself.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>Being able to understand the emotional state in yourself and others is essential to effective teamwork and community building. You could flow through a project and avoid all conflict on a fluke but more likely than not you would run into some clash of ideas or clash of who gets which coffee cup at some stage. When these situations arise it is important to be able to stay calm and solve the issue with clarity of mind. Failing to do so could lead to further conflict and loss of productivity. It is also important to know how you react to different stimuli to ensure that you can be efficient in what you do without getting distracted too easily.</p>
