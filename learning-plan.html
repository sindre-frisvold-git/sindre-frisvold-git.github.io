        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        <p class="intro">If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail.</p>

        <h2>Long Term Goals</h2>
        <p>This is quite a broad question. I guess I will attack it on a few different levels and arenas.</p>
        <p>Career wise it would be great to get involved in the video game development industry. This however is not my main goal and thus might be seen as a bit vague. In all honesty I just want tobe in a position where I am given creative freedom (to a reasonable degree) to solve given issues.</p>
        <p>Family wise I want to be able to control my working hours and locales to the point that I can freely shift things around to fit my schedule to my family. Being able to be free during the day to be active with my loved ones and or having the freedom to travel to the other side of the earth for a few months is at the core of my motivation in doing this course.
            <p>Self realisation wise I want to be able to go to bed being exited about getting up the next morning to solve current or the next sets of problems. This ofcourse being in addition to getting paid for it.</p></p>

        <h2>My Learning: Strengths and Limitations</h2>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>I have had confidence in my own abilities to a fault throughout my life due to having a knack to mastering the basics of activities and challenges effortlessly. This has led to me getting frustrated when I cannot master something quickly and leaving it behind.</p>
        <p>I think the material provided has described this as the “fixed mindset”;I have thought that if I cannot master something it is because I am simply not good at that specific skill and that there is nothing I can do about it, other people are simply better.</p>
        <p>I can also get very “know-it-all”y when it comes to skills I am good at as I am very confident in my decision-making capabilities once I have made one (i.e., decision).</p>
        <p>This leads to friction and me separating myself from peers as I can be frustrating to work with and I get frustrated when I think the solution being worked on is an inefficient one.</p>
        <p>I am well aware of the fallacy in that statement and I am working on trusting others more, I know there is too much that I don’t know to make a true critical decision around any solution I don’t like at any time.</p>
        <p>A limitation and strength combined is my drive to help others. When I have knowledge to share or I see a solution that can help others I immediately want to share this with them and assist in any task. This is born out of a wish for the success of everyone but can be seen as preachy and arrogant. I have thought about this through having someone do this to me and how I would react myself.</p>
        <p>As per my previous point I am learning to appreciate other solutions than my own brainchildren as I know there are many ways, and many ways that lead to the same destination.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <p>When I start to understand a topic/skill I get deeply invested and strive to understand the underlying mechanics of the topic/skill.</p>
        <p>This leads me to unorthodox solutions sometimes but it also allows me to think outside of the box and create new concepts for myself. I have found this invaluable to my own learning journeys.</p>
        <p>This can also be a limitation to my own learning and development as it steers me away from common conventions and procedures.</p>
        <p>I need to work on this to apply both outside the box and inside the box thinking to avoid going away from the programming mantra “do not reinvent the wheel”</p>
        <p>Funny story here: When I started playing with javascript, I coded my own .push() and .map() methods before I realised they already existed. I started googling more after that to avoid such time sinks in the future.</p>
        <p>I am very open to new concepts and ideas, especially given time to ponder them. This has already changed my perceptions on learning through learning and reflecting on growth mindsets and relating it to my own personal experiences.</p>
        <p>This will help me overcome difficult concepts when my brain accepts that things are not what they initially seemed.</p>
        <p>My new freedom found through believing in anybody’s ability to practice and master any skill helps keep the “you are not good enough for this” demons away.</p>

        <h2>Workload management</h2>
        <p>During Foundations (and Bootcamp subsequently) I will as my number one pillar utilise my reliability and sense of responsibility to ensure no disadvantage to befall any of my peers or the facilitators.</p>
        <p>When other people rely on me I have a deep rooted drive to follow through on my commitments and I have thus far in life been unable to break this tradition; I am not planning on starting now.</p>
        <p>If I have made an appointment or scheduled a meeting with peers, facilitators or any other related 3rd party I will to the point where it is within my power uphold my commitment. If for reasons beyond my control I will not be able to follow through I will at the earliest opportunity communicate this to the affected parties.</p>
        <p>In order to meet deadlines during Foundations I am working on setting a strict schedule to ensure I have opportunity and minimal distractions when it comes to completing coursework.</p>
        <p>My aim for each sprint is to have the main objective for the week done in time for my Thursday facilitator catch-up</p>
        <br>
        <p>If I start falling behind I will dedicate more time during the day to complete the work. If this fails to diminish the increasing proverbial mountain of work I will discuss with my facilitator no later than Friday 12pm.</p>
        <p>Further to this I will not hesitate to seek help and advise from my peers in the Slack threads.</p>
        <p>If I am stuck on something for more than 2 pomodoro cycles I will seek help.</p>

        <h2>Expectations from Facilitation Team</h2>
        <p>As we are lucky enough to have a good student to facilitator ratio I expect that we all will have access to the help we need within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
        <p>The way I expect to receive help and guidance from the team will be with simple hints initially to help me develop my own investigative skills (read: googling), with incrementing help as it becomes apparent I am just unable to grasp a given topic at that point in time.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Commitments</h2>
        <p>Being a recent first time father/pappa I am commited to being present during the Foundations penta-week. My favourite day currently is Tuesday as we have a swim class for our little boy in the morning.</p>
        <p>For any parents reading this you will also know the incredible strain motherhood has; especially for first-time moms and in the first year. As I love my family and they are my pride and joy I am likely to take 1 week off my scheduled work to help offload "mamma" more. I will still be working, just not as regimented.</p>
        <p>It is important to spend as much time as is practical with them as they are going away for the majority of Bootcamp to support my need to stay fully focused on the prophecised extremely high workload.</p>
