        <h2>Long Term Goals</h2>
        <p>This is quite a broad question. I guess I will attack it on a few different levels and arenas.</p>
        <p>Career wise it would be great to get involved in the video game development industry. This however is not my main goal and thus might be seen as a bit vague. In all honesty I just want tobe in a position where I am given creative freedom (to a reasonable degree) to solve given issues.</p>
        <p>Family wise I want to be able to control my working hours and locales to the point that I can freely shift things around to fit my schedule to my family. Being able to be free during the day to be active with my loved ones and or having the freedom to travel to the other side of the earth for a few months is at the core of my motivation in doing this course.
            <p>Self realisation wise I want to be able to go to bed being exited about getting up the next morning to solve current or the next sets of problems. This ofcourse being in addition to getting paid for it.</p></p>

        <h2>My Learning: Strengths and Limitations</h2>
        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <p>I have had confidence in my own abilities to a fault throughout my life due to having a knack to mastering the basics of activities and challenges effortlessly. This has led to me getting frustrated when I cannot master something quickly and leaving it behind.</p>
        <p>I think the material provided has described this as the “fixed mindset”;I have thought that if I cannot master something it is because I am simply not good at that specific skill and that there is nothing I can do about it, other people are simply better.</p>
        <p>I can also get very “know-it-all”y when it comes to skills I am good at as I am very confident in my decision-making capabilities once I have made one (i.e., decision).</p>
        <p>This leads to friction and me separating myself from peers as I can be frustrating to work with and I get frustrated when I think the solution being worked on is an inefficient one.</p>
