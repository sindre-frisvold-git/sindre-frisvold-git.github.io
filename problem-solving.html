      <h1>Problem-Solving</h1>

    <section>
        <p>Today I am going to discuss problem solving and my own experience with it. Problem solving has many components and common techniques but the essence is to break a bigger problem into many smaller manageable problems. This way you can start solving more complex problems and avoid getting stuck before you even begin. To invoke a callback from a previous post: “Divide et impera”.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Scenario 1: when I was stuck</h2>
        <p>I was working through a problem where I was required to create a simple program that would search through multiple items looking for the right one. In essence I had to look through a shelf with 5 boxes of which each box had a name and a number. If the name was the one I was looking for I needed to present the number from the same box.</p>
        <p>My program kept throwing errors at me that the shelf did not exist to which I responded: “of course it does!”. In the end it turns out it did not exist and that was why it stated that. You see when we test a program we can send empty information at it to see what happens; if no exceptions have been made for empty information it simply will not work. Liken it to someone lazy, refusing to do anything they have not been told to do.</p>
        <p>The problem was easily solved when I added an exception for when there was no shelf and all was good again.</p>
        <p>To get to this conclusion I told the program to become an echo chamber and yell all the information it received back at me. This way I could see that it was just sending silence back which gave me a hint. I kept having the program echo back at me with information from different parts of the program until we understood each other and I could provide the needed instructions to complete the transformation from lazy worker to efficient, clean, shelf searching machine.</p>
        <p>I was getting quite frustrated through the middle of the process as I tried multiple approaches including testing my program on a different shelf; It searched through the other shelf perfectly. I decided that I was doing something wrong and to keep looking until I found the problem.</p>
        <p>I learned that there is usually a simple solution to small problems; I tried to overcomplicate it. Looking back at the problem the solution I ended up with was obvious and simple and more elegant than the complicated workaround I was trying to achieve. I will make sure that my solutions only target the problem at hand and avoid narrow umbrella solutions; this might cause compatibility problems in the future as well.</p>
        <h2>Scenario 2: elegant solution</h2>
        <p>We had a collection of problems to solve as part of our coding practice. I found the solution to a few of these problems straight forward so I decided to attempt to solve them with as little code as possible.</p>
        <p>When writing code, one thing that is important to consider is readability. This refers to how easy it is for someone coming after you looking at the code to understand what it does. The less code being used for each function the easier it is to understand at a glance (in most cases, you can definitely write something short and confusing).</p>
        <p>To solve the aforementioned problems I thought about the minimal steps needed to complete the task. I then made use of built in features called methods to complete the challenge in one line. This can be done for most simple problems if your solution comprises programs that do one thing and one thing well. If I cannot simplify a function into a single line it might be too complex.</p>

        <h2>Problem solving techniques:</h2>
        <h3>Pseudocode:</h3>
        <p>I feel like I am able to use it efficiently but I still need more practice being more concise and breaking problems down into smaller pieces.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Trying something:</h3>
        <p>I enjoy this method of problem solving. I like looking at what I want a program to do, writing it, passing it some code and seeing what happens. If it works it works. If it doesn’t I can tinker with it and see what the output is, this allows me to get an understanding of how different components work.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Rubber ducky method:</h3>
        <p>I haven’t literally tried this one yet but I have found it beneficial to explain a problem to someone else even though they didn’t understand it. I understand the concept of it though as saying something out loud can sometimes reveal the obvious.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Console.logging:</h3>
        <p>I use this one all the time. Placing logging at different points within functions lets me see what the function is doing to the information passed and what information is getting handled. This one is invaluable.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Googling:</h3>
        <p>I am able to find answers to simple problems I have through googling. I am getting comfortable looking for the resources I trust will contain the information I need. I still haven’t had much experience googling more complex problems although in the end every complex problem should be broken down into smaller simple problems nonetheless.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Asking your peers and coaches for help:</h3>
        <p>For this one, I am still found wanting. I haven’t encountered any problems thus far where I have been adequately stuck to ask for help. I feel like when the time comes I will spend a bit of time formulating the question. I still have question asking anxiety following learning about formulating good questions; I really need the questions to be formulated perfectly before I post. This should improve as I get more experience after asking a few questions. I am also really bad at asking for help in general. This is something I am aware of and working on.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>Improving your process with reflection:</h3>
        <p>This is getting better, but I still need a lot of practice to implement this as a natural part of my process. I find I learn well through reflection but I am bad at inducing it post exercise.</p>
